# Low Poly Shooter Pack

## Overview

The _Low Poly Shooter Pack_ is an asset envisioned and created by David Stenfors with the purpose of facilitating the creation of first-person shooter games. The asset first came out as a **Unity-only** package, but has now grown to become a multi-engine project that allows both **Unity** and **Unreal Engine 4** developers to make their very own outstanding first-person games!

Nowadays, the asset has grown, and so has the [team]() behind it! This allows us to make bigger changes and additions, and overall provide developers a better product to use!

### Purpose

If you’re curious about what you can do with the asset and what the vision behind it is, you’ve come to the right section!

Whether you are a new developer, or an industry veteran, you can find a good use for the _Low Poly Shooter Pack_. You could use the meshes and animations to **prototype** your game while writing the code yourself if you’re a programmer, or maybe use the **built-in code** as a base for your game while creating your own art assets if you’re an artist. The sky is the limit, and we’re constantly expanding with new and exciting content!

Another significant thing to do with the asset is to use it as reference, or as learning material. This one is possibly the most important reason the asset exists. Educating newer developers, or inspiring more knowledgeable people, is what we strive for! 

That said, we also need inspiration ourselves, so anyone that has any cool ideas or thoughts on how we can improve and make the asset better can [contact]() us!

### Need

To us it is also very important to explain to you guys not only what we’re making but also why we’re making it. This seems to be something missing from lots of other cool projects, no-one wants to explain the why, which is very frustrating! 

The _Low Poly Shooter Pack_ is an asset we work on in order to allow people to chase their dreams, to make the best games they can and, in all honesty, to allow us to play some good first-person games from these developers!

It’s that simple, really. Of course, it is also a business for us, but our primary aim is to make a cool product for developers to use, and we hope that shows in the project itself!

We’re just as passionate about making games as you are, so let’s make the best games together!
